- Keep track of game version in a single place and use that value in all DataDragon requests.

- Ensure every part of the template works with less than all the info filled in.
  - ex. not all player spots filled, not all item slots used, etc

- Remember to add CSS for directives, especially if things appear wonky after adding them!
  - This is usually the problem if setting `replace` to `true` on a directive "fixes" things.

- Background of summoner basic info box: have vertical slices, arranged horizontally, of champion splash art,
1 for each of their top X ranked champs, by use frequency.

- Revise game-participants.html to use ng-repeat directive.

- Don't show trinket label on match history if not SR map.
  - Also don't show label if no trinket?

- Currently we label a summoner's team as 5s or 3s only, whichever it has stats for.
  If it has stats for both 5s and 3s, the label that is chosen could be either.
